#### Technologies:

This project was generated with **Angular**.
For styling I used Bootstrap.

During developing of this project I worked with such features: 
- create Components
- create and use Attribute and Structural Directives
- create and use Services and Dependency Injection (Cross component communicaton)
- add Routing and work with Quarry Parameters, Redirections, Guards etc
- work with RxJS (Observables, Operators)
- use Pipes to transform Output
- create Forms (with Template-Driven and Reactive approach)
- work with Firebase by making Http Requests for storing and fetching data
- add Authentication and Route Protection
- optimize app with splitting Modules and adding Lazy Loading
